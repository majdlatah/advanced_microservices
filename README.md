# Advanced microservices
A toy example of RPC microservices

we used Google Cloud to implement simple yet more complex micro services scenario based on docker containers, RabbitMQ (Message Broker) and Nameko (Remote Procedure Call (RPC) inter-service-communication) frameworks. 
Flask is used to implement the API gateway.

As shown below the COMPUTING service first checks whether the customer exists or not using Customer Services to get the customer ID and Email, then it will amount given by the user to (dolar, euro). Finally, it will use the MAIL service to send the result of to the userâ€™s email address. The communication is done based on RPC communication. Nameko services are containers.
